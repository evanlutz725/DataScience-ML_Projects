###Start by importing chipotle order tsv file with pandas

import pandas as pd
col_names = ['order_id','quantity','item_name','choice_description','item_price']
chipotle = pd.read_csv('/home/evan/Downloads/Data_Science/week-1/data/orders.tsv', header = 1, sep = '\t', names = col_names)

###Find the average amount of an order

totalOrders = chipotle['order_id'].count()

orderDict = {}
for line in chipotle.values:
    line0 = line[0] #order_id
    if line0 not in orderDict.keys():
        orderDict[line0] = line[1]*float(line[4].lstrip('$'))
    else:
        orderDict[line0] += line[1]*float(line[4].lstrip('$'))

sum(orderDict.values())/totalOrders #Average cost per order is $8.49

###Find the total number of different drinks that were sold that day

import numpy as np
chipotle.values
drinksArr = []
foodWords = ['Burrito','Chips','Bowl','Salsa','Salad','Tacos']
for line in chipotle.values:
    containVar = False
    for word in foodWords:
        if (word in line[2]):
            containVar = True
        else:
            pass
    if containVar == False:
        drinksArr.append(line[2])
            
drinkNum = set(drinksArr)
print (set(drinkNum))
len(drinkNum) #6 different drinks

###Find the average number of toppings per burrito

toppingsNumList = []
for line in chipotle.values:
    itemNum = 0
    if 'Burrito' in line[2]:
        line = line[3].split(',')
        lenline = len(line)
        toppingsNumList.append(lenline)
np.average(toppingsNumList) # the average is 5.395 toppings per burrito, including salsas.

###Find the percentage of chip sales by type.
#The highest chip sales by percentage were Chips and Guacamole at 44%

chipTypes = {}
for entry in chipotle.values:
    if 'Chips' in entry[2]:
        if entry[2] not in chipTypes.keys():
            chipTypes[entry[2]] = 1
        else:
            chipTypes[entry[2]]  += 1
chipSum = sum(chipTypes.values()) #total chip order is 1083
for key in chipTypes.keys():
    print (key, ' were ', round((int(chipTypes[key])/int(chipSum)),2), ' percentage of chip sales.\n')
